#Basic extensions (USING BRANCH_ONE)
*Create a method that decreases customer funds when they buy a ticket. I've included code that brings in the update function, so the DB is also affected. DONE *

*Check how many tickets have been bought by a particular customer - responsibility could lie in customer or ticket class, so I have put it in both. A customer might want to know how many tickets he/she has (e.g. for budgeting), and the cinema (represented by the ticket class) might want to know the same information for marketing purposes. DONE *

*Check how many customers are going to watch a certain film - film class has responsibility. This function can be performed by taking the array from the .customers method, putting it into a new array, then counting it (.length method) (even simpler, just do .customers.length!!) DONE *

This completes the Basic Extensions. :star: REALLY WELL DONE! :star:

#Advanced Extensions (USING BRANCH_TWO)
*Create a screenings table that lets us know what time films are showing

*Write a method that finds out what is the most popular time (most tickets sold) for a given film

*Limit the available tickets for screenings.

*Add any other extensions you think would be great to have at a cinema!

This completes the Advanced Extensions. :star: AMAZING!! :star:
