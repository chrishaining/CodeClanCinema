*Console testing*

#Problems I encountered/key things I learned#
*Remodelling the system when the client's requirements changed. That is, the system I modelled for the Minimum Viable Product required changes when I worked on the Basic Extensions, and when I got to the Advanced Extensions there were a lot of changes to make. This meant a lot of changes to the code, too. It has made me appreciate the importance of modelling.*
*It was not always clear to me which class should have responsibility for each function. Moreover, my decisions changed as new requirements were added in the Basic and Advanced Extensions.*
*I have been practising using branches in git. This was extremely helpful when I was unsure of where to place responsibility for a function.*
